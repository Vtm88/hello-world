# hello-world 
My first repository
This is where my adventure begins...
I am new here and I hope I can land a career in Software engineering/developer/devops soon...

I love automation and scripting.. creating code that works...


#Update on 15/11/2022
Passed interview and landed my first job as Software Engineering - Cloud Technology in October 2022
1st challenge - Project required experienced developers...and... I am from Data background..
Project assessment = Not suitable , reason = capability are self-learned, lacked of working experience..

My train of thoughts:
"Everybody has to start somewhere, just needa an opportunity.
Oh well, maybe this is not the one. Keep positive, keep grinding, better opportunities ahead! "
